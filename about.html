            <h3>Welcome to my portfolio site!</h3> 
            <p>My Name is <b>Zwelinzima Paul Ncube </b>, and I'm 31 years of age. I was born and
                raised in Mpumalanga in a humble town called Tweefontein. Moved to the city, Johannesburg, a few years ago to pursue
                an education.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I have always had a fascination for computers since the very first time a ever landed one -- an old desktop
                    running a Microsoft Windows Vista.</p>
            <p>Although I had a basic experience with computers, I would only discover coding years later during the infamous
                    global pandemic -- Covid 19 -- and during lockdown. I went on YouTube to learn how to code and later landed on a
                    website called freecodecamp.org, and this is where I learned responsive web design.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I went on to register for short courses on Shaw Academy (now Upskillist) and then stated building a few
                project...</p>
            <p>An aspiring Software Engineer with a specific interest in Mechine Learning.</p>
            <p>I have a passion for tech and innovation. I want to be part of developing tech solutions that bring prosperity to our
                continent, and see us participate in this 4th Industrial Revolution AKA the age of AI.</p>
